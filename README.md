# Leetcode Practice Problems - Ruby

The intention of this repository is to serve as a central hub for all of my algorithm practice on the Leetcode website.  The repo is divided into `lib` and `test` folders.  The `test` files will correspond to a file of the same name in `lib`, giving me a way to continue practicing Test-Driven Development.  All problems are solved using Ruby and all tests are written in Minitest.  The `lib` folder holds files that contain the website-approved solution to the problem.

Thanks for viewing!
