# Leetcode & CodeWars Practice Problems

The intention of this repository is to serve as a central hub for all of my algorithm practice on both Leetcode and CodeWars sites.  The repo is divided into `lib` and `test` folders.  The `test` files will correspond to a file of the same name in `lib`, giving me a way to continue practicing Test-Driven Development.  All tests are written in Minitest.  The `lib` folder holds files that contain the website-approved solution to the problem.

Files with names beginning in an integer are Leetcode problems, corresponding to the number of the problem as hosted on the site.

Files with names beginning in `cw_` are CodeWars problems.

Thanks for viewing!
